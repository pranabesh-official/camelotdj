# CamelotDJ - Music Analyzer

An open-source music analysis platform inspired by [Mixed In Key](https://mixedinkey.com/), designed to help DJs and music producers discover the key, BPM, and energy level of their tracks for harmonic mixing.

## 🎵 Features

- **Key Detection**: Automatically detect musical keys using advanced audio analysis
- **BPM Analysis**: Accurate BPM detection for beat matching
- **Energy Level Rating**: Unique energy level ratings to help create dynamic DJ sets
- **Harmonic Mixing**: Use the Camelot Wheel system for seamless track transitions
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Electron for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Python Backend**: Powerful audio analysis engine built with Python
- **React Frontend**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **Firebase Integration**: Cloud-based user authentication and data storage
- **USB Export**: Export analyzed tracks to USB devices for DJ software

## 🎯 What is Harmonic Mixing?

Harmonic mixing is a technique used by professional DJs to create seamless transitions between tracks by matching their musical keys. When tracks are in compatible keys, they blend together naturally, creating a more professional and enjoyable listening experience.

CamelotDJ helps you:
- Identify the key of any track in your music library
- Find tracks that will mix harmonically together
- Create playlists that flow seamlessly from one track to the next
- Understand the energy progression of your sets

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application uses a hybrid architecture:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with modern UI components
- **Backend**: Python Flask with music analysis engines (Librosa, Essentia)
- **Desktop**: Electron for cross-platform compatibility
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for cloud storage and authentication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Python 3.8+** (Anaconda recommended)
- **Git**
- **Firebase Account** (for authentication and data storage)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranabesh-official/camelotdj.git
   cd camelotdj
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm rebuild
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # On Windows, use cmd instead of PowerShell
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate camelotdj
   
   # Or use pip directly
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp env.example .env.local
   
   # Edit .env.local with your Firebase credentials
   # The file should contain:
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project-default-rtdb.region.firebasedatabase.app
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase project** at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. **Enable services**:
   - Authentication (with Google sign-in)
   - Firestore Database
   - Realtime Database
   - Storage
   - Analytics (optional)
3. **Get your configuration**:
   - Go to Project Settings → General → Your apps
   - Click the web app icon (</>) to add a web app
   - Copy the config object
4. **Update `.env.local`** with your Firebase credentials

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Enable APIs**:
   - Google+ API
   - Google Identity Toolkit API
3. **Create OAuth 2.0 credentials**:
   - Go to APIs & Services → Credentials
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Set application type to "Web application"
   - Add authorized origins: `http://localhost:3001`, `http://127.0.0.1:3001`
   - Add authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`
4. **Copy credentials** to `.env.local`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **Firebase Configuration Errors**
If you see "Missing required Firebase environment variables":
```bash
# Check if .env.local exists and has correct content
cat .env.local

# Ensure all REACT_APP_FIREBASE_* variables are set
grep "REACT_APP_FIREBASE" .env.local

# Restart the development server after making changes
npm run start
```

#### 2. **Port Conflicts**
If you see "Something is already running on port 3001":
```bash
# Check what's using port 3001
lsof -i :3001

# Kill conflicting processes
pkill -f "react-scripts"
pkill -f "craco"

# Or use a different port
PORT=3002 npm run start
```

#### 3. **Blank Screen in Production Build**
If the app shows a blank screen after building:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run build
npm run main-build

# Check the console for build directory errors
# Ensure all build files are properly unpacked
```

#### 4. **Python Backend Issues**
If the Python backend fails to start:
```bash
# Check Python environment
conda activate camelotdj
python --version

# Install missing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test Python API directly
cd python
python api.py --apiport 5002 --signingkey devkey
```

### Environment Variable Debugging

The app includes comprehensive debugging for environment variables. Check the console for:
```
🔍 Environment Variables Debug:
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY: ✅ Set
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN: ✅ Set
🔥 Firebase Config: { apiKey: "✅ Set", ... }
```

If you see ❌ Missing, check your `.env.local` file.

## 🎧 How It Works

1. **Audio Analysis**: Python backend analyzes audio files using advanced signal processing
2. **Key Detection**: Identifies musical keys using the Camelot Wheel system
3. **BPM Analysis**: Detects tempo and beat patterns
4. **Energy Rating**: Assigns energy levels based on audio characteristics
5. **Harmonic Matching**: Suggests compatible tracks for mixing
6. **Export**: Generate playlists compatible with major DJ software

## 🎵 Music Analysis Features

### Key Detection
- Uses both Essentia KeyExtractor and Librosa chroma analysis
- Provides both traditional notation (A minor) and Camelot notation (8A)
- Supports all major and minor keys

### BPM Analysis
- Essentia RhythmExtractor2013 for accurate tempo detection
- Librosa verification for consistency
- Perfect for beatmatching and set planning

### Energy Level Rating
- 1-10 scale energy analysis
- Based on multiple factors: RMS, spectral features, dynamics
- Helps create perfect energy progression in your sets

## 🎛️ Harmonic Mixing

The application includes a visual Camelot Wheel that shows:
- **Perfect matches**: Same key (8A → 8A)
- **Energy progression**: +1 key (8A → 9A)
- **Mood changes**: Same number, different letter (8A → 8B)

## 🛠️ Development

### Testing the Python Backend
```bash
cd python
python3 api.py --apiport 5000 --signingkey devkey
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/graphiql/` for the GraphQL interface.

### Building for Distribution
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a packaged application with:
- Python backend compiled with PyInstaller
- React frontend built and optimized
- Platform-specific installer in `dist/`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenSSL Error (Node.js 17+)**
   ```bash
   export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Python Dependencies Missing**
   ```bash
   pip3 install librosa essentia mutagen flask flask-cors flask-graphql
   ```

3. **Firebase Configuration Error**
   - Ensure all environment variables are set in `.env.local`
   - Check Firebase project settings and permissions

4. **Port 5000 in Use**
   - Backend will automatically find an available port
   - Or manually specify: `python3 api.py --apiport 5001`
